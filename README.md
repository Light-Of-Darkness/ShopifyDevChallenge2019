# README

This was created for the development challenge for Shopify's 2019 internship applications.

Some of the dependencies have vulnerabilities that have been found since, however this was a one-off so I will not be updating this.

To run, simply start the rails server using `bin/rails server` while in the root directory.
The address will be localhost:3000
